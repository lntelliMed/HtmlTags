		<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply <strong>dummy</strong> text of the
		printing and typesetting industry. <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> has been the
		industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
		printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen
		book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
		electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
		popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets
		containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
		publishing software like <em>Aldus PageMaker</em> including versions
		of Lorem Ipsum.
	</p>

	<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random
		text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45
		BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
		professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the
		more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
		going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
		discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections
		1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes
		of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise
		on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
		first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from
		a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
